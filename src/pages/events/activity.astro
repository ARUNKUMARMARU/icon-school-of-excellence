    paragraph=` we enhance learning with weekly hands-on
                                activities across all subjects. In science,
                                students perform interactive experiments, while
                                in language arts, creative writing workshops and
                                storytelling sessions build communication
                                skills. Mathematics involves real-world
                                problem-solving, and social studies uses
                                role-playing to explore history and cultures.
                                Art and music projects foster creativity and
                                self-expression, while physical education
                                promotes teamwork and fitness through games.
                                These activities help students engage deeply
                                with the curriculum, encouraging a love for
                                learning in every subject`
