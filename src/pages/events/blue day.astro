    paragraph=` We celebrated a joyful Blue Colour Day with
                                Nursery and KG students, who came dressed in
                                various shades of blue. The day was filled with
                                fun activities, including blue-themed arts and
                                crafts where students created beautiful artwork.
                                Through storytelling and games, they learned
                                about the significance of the color blue in
                                nature and culture. The atmosphere was lively,
                                filled with laughter and creativity. Thank you
                                to all the students and families who made this
                                day special, and we look forward to more
                                colorful celebrations in the future!`
