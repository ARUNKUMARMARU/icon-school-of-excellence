                  hosted an Interdisciplinary Science & Social Studies
                  Exhibition. The event showcased the creativity and hard work
                  of our students as they presented innovative projects that
                  seamlessly integrated scientific concepts with social studies
                  themes. From models of sustainable energy solutions to
                  historical timelines, the exhibition covered a wide range of
                  topics, highlighting the connection between science, society,
                  and the environment. The students demonstrated their deep
                  understanding through interactive displays, experiments, and
                  presentations, impressing visitors with their knowledge and
                  enthusiasm. It was a remarkable day of learning and
                  exploration, reflecting the dedication to academic excellence
                  and holistic development at our school`
