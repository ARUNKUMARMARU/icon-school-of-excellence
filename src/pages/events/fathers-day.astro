    paragraph=` At Icon School of Excellence, we celebrated
                                Father’s Day with a heartfelt activity where our
                                students created personalized cards for their
                                fathers. This initiative allowed children to
                                express their love and appreciation in a
                                meaningful way. Through this activity we extend
                                our warmest wishes to all the incredible fathers
                                in our community. Thank you for your unwavering
                                support and dedication!`
