    paragraph=` Icon School of Excellence offers a variety of
                                trips and programs to enrich students'
                                experiences. Educational trips to museums or
                                historical sites connect classroom learning with
                                real-world applications, while fun trips to
                                amusement parks or nature reserves provide
                                relaxation and teamwork opportunities. The
                                social outreach program encourages community
                                service, fostering empathy and responsibility
                                through activities like volunteering or donation
                                drives. Additionally, an annual enrichment trip
                                exposes students to arts, culture, or sports,
                                broadening their perspectives and inspiring new
                                interests`
