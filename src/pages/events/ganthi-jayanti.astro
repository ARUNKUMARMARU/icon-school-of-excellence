    paragraph=` Gandhi Jayanti was celebrated with inspiring
                                speeches highlighting Mahatma Gandhi's
                                principles of non-violence and truth. Skits and
                                songs illustrated his teachings, while students
                                participated in a community service activity
                                (Swachh Bharat Abhiyan), embodying his spirit of
                                selflessness. The celebration deepened
                                appreciation for Gandhi's legacy and encouraged
                                everyone to embrace his ideals in daily life.`
