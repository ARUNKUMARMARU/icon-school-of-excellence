    paragraph=` We celebrated Grandparents Day, honoring the
                                special bond between students and their
                                grandparents. Nursery and KG students welcomed
                                them with handmade cards and heartfelt
                                performances, including songs and poems
                                celebrating their wisdom and love. Fun
                                activities like storytelling and arts and crafts
                                allowed families to create lasting memories
                                together. The event highlighted the invaluable
                                role grandparents play in our lives, fostering a
                                strong sense of community. Thank you to all the
                                grandparents who made this day truly
                                unforgettable!`
