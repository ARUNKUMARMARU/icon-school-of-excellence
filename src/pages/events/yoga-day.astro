    paragraph=`We celebrated both the International Day of Yoga
                                and World Music Day. Our students participated
                                in invigorating yoga sessions, promoting
                                physical and mental well-being. Additionally,
                                they delivered insightful speeches on the
                                significance of music in our lives, showcasing
                                their creativity and public speaking skills.
                                These events fostered a greater appreciation for
                                both yoga and music, enriching our students'
                                overall educational experience`
