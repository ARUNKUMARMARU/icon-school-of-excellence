                        Our primary focus is on fostering a solid grasp of core

                        /><br />

                        <b>Deep Learning:</b> We encourage students to explore the
                        "why" and "how" behind concepts, which nurtures critical
                        thinking and analytical skills. By engaging with the material
                        at a deeper level, students are better equipped to apply
                        their knowledge across different subjects and in real-world
                        situations. <br /><br />
                        <b>Interdisciplinary Connections:</b> We help students make
